# 🧳 Tourism Data Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes a large and messy tourism dataset to uncover insights about traveler demographics, behavior, and spending patterns. The goal is to inform tourism promotion strategies and improve service delivery using data-driven insights.

## 🔧 Tools Used
- **Python (Jupyter Notebook)** – Data cleaning and exploration
- **Excel** – Power Query, Pivot Tables, and basic visualizations
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard creation
- **PowerPoint** – Final presentation deck

## 🧼 Data Cleaning & Exploration (Python)
Performed in `Data Cleaning and Exploration.ipynb`:
- Imported and cleaned raw data using `pandas`
- Handled missing values, standardized columns (country names, feedback, purpose, etc.)
- Added derived columns: Tourist ID, Age Group
- Created visualizations (bar charts, heatmaps, line charts, pie charts) using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Exported cleaned dataset to `.csv` for dashboarding

## 📊 Excel Steps
See `Tourism Data.xlsx`:
- Imported data and cleaned using Power Query
- Built Pivot Tables to explore visitor purposes, country distribution, and monthly trends
- Added charts to enhance interpretability

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard
See `Tourism Dashboard.pbix`:
- Created an interactive dashboard with filters, cards, and charts
- Visualized visitor purposes, gender split, monthly trends, top countries, and spending patterns
- Dashboard supports strategic decisions in tourism marketing

## 📌 Key Insights
- Visitors are equally split between males and females
- Business and leisure are the dominant reasons for visits
- Most travel occurs in **May**
- Middle-aged travelers are the most common
- **France, UK, USA, Germany, Egypt, China, India, and Spain** account for over 80% of all visits
- Conference/study visitors spend more than others

## 🎯 Recommendations
- Target marketing efforts toward middle-aged business and leisure travelers
- Focus campaigns around May (peak travel month)
- Ensure gender-neutral marketing
- Prioritize data collection quality for better insights in future studies

## 📁 Files Included
- `Data Cleaning and Exploration.ipynb` – Python notebook for data wrangling
- `Tourism Dashboard.pbix` – Power BI interactive dashboard
- `Presentation.pptx` – Final project presentation
- `Tourist data clean.csv` – Cleaned up CSV file
